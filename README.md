This is an unofficial Centrifuge PHP **server** SDK. More information on the [official documentation page](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/server_api#http-api).

## Requirements

### Publish
Example on how to publish data to a channel:
```php
use Mvrc\CentrifugePhp\CentrifugeConnector;
use Mvrc\CentrifugePhp\Requests\PublishRequest;

$connector = new CentrifugeConnector;
$request = new PublishRequest(
    channel: "private-test",
    data: [
        "test" => true
    ]
);

$response = $connector->send($request);

print_r($response->json());
print_r($response->status());
```

## Available requests

| Request | Description |
| - | - | 
| BatchRequest | Batch allows sending many commands in one request. | 
| BroadcastRequest | broadcast is similar to publish but allows to efficiently send the same data into many channels. | 
| ChannelsRequest | channels return active channels (with one or more active subscribers in it). |
